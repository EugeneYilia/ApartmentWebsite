            <h3 style="margin-left: 45%; font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;">South Africa</h3>
            <p>South Africa has millions of annual foreign visitors who purchase property once they experience our
                beautiful country and its people.</p>
            <p>South Africa is reputed to have one of the best deeds registration systems worldwide, with an exceptional
                degree of accuracy and security of tenure being guaranteed.</p>
            <p>This is according to Craig Hutchison, CEO Engel & Völkers Southern Africa, who says that although there
                has been some uncertainty about foreign investors being allowed to own property in SA, this has now been
                dispelled.</p>
            <p>Foreigners can purchase and own immovable property in South Africa without restriction - non-nationals
                are subject to the same laws as nationals. The only ineligible people are illegal aliens who are not
                allowed to own immovable property in SA.</p>
            <p>Hutchison says political and macroeconomic uncertainties have taken centre stage following President
                Jacob Zuma's cabinet reshuffle and the firing of the minister of finance and his deputy on the 30th of
                March. The subsequent downgrades by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch have further increased concerns about
                South Africa's economic outlook.</p>
            <p>“Although political and economic conditions do impact on the property industry, we stand firm that
                property still remains your best investment, as housing is not an optional extra,” says Hutchison</p>
            <p>“We can remain proud of our country as it has many unique aspects. The possibility is that you could
                potentially come across an international visitor wishing to purchase a second home, and we thus look
                into the process to familiarise you with the ins and outs.”</p>
            <p>He says South Africa is reputed to have one of the best deeds registration systems worldwide, with an
                exceptional degree of accuracy and security of tenure being guaranteed. Property can be owned
                individually, jointly in undivided shares or by an entity such as a company, close corporation, trust or
                a similar entity registered outside South Africa</p>
            <p>Hutchison says an international investor would need to work through a reputable and global real estate
                company, so that they are assured of both an ethical as well as a professional service and that their
                transactions are handled in an efficient and legal manner.</p>
            <p>“We only work with transferring attorneys who are reliable and well-known, so they will be able to advise
                international investors of any specific local regulations that they need to be aware of,” he says.

                “Our South African property sale processes are acknowledged as being structured, secure and
                professionally managed.”

                Hutchison says a substantial percentage of the current market is being fuelled by foreign exchange.

                Willing investors or expats looking to buy a permanent holding or holiday home can expect to pay on
                average R950 000, which adds up to about €53 000, for a small home (80sqm to 140sqm), R2 million, or
                €111 000, for a medium-sized home (141sqm to 220sqm), and for really extravagant and special homes of
                between R20 million to R50 million, this amounts to a mere €1.1 million.

                Investing in South Africa, according to the FNB House Price Index:

                - 4.89% of SA homes are owned by foreign investors.

                - The first quarter 2017 Foreign Home Buyer Confidence Index was +0.09, from -0.016.

                - In euro terms, the FNB House Price Index rose by 24.3% year-on-year, in dollar terms by 19.3%, and in
                UK pound terms by 36.5% (the Brexit impact) year-on-year in February. Secondary home buying has risen to
                14.47% by the first quarter of 2017.

                - Buy-to-let homes remain the major driver of secondary home demand, accounting for 9.5% of total home
                buying in the first quarter.

                - In the first quarter of 2017, holiday home buying comprised 3.77% of all sales.

                - Buying a home for a family member or relative to live in remains at around 1%.

                - In total, secondary properties make up an estimated 16.24% as at January 2017.
            </p>

            <h4 style="color: #E69432">Before buying</h4>
            <p>Non-residents who are intending to stay in their SA property for long periods will need to comply with
                the Immigration Act, and may need to acquire a residence.

                Within the first week of arriving in South Africa, foreigners must apply for an extension on their
                90-day visa from the new visa centres as this will no longer be done through the Home Affairs offices.

                Non-residents who are purchasing property in the name of a company or other legal entity rather than in
                their own names will first have to register that entity in SA and appoint a local public officer.

                Legal capacity to enter into a sale agreement

                The buying and selling of property in South Africa is governed in terms of our common law. The
                transferring attorney's requirements to conclude the transfer are almost the same as that of a transfer
                to a South African resident, except that, regardless of your foreign marriage regime, your spouse still
                has to sign all the documents pertaining to the purchase of the property.
            </p>


            <h4 style="margin-top: 5%;color: #E69432;">Making an offer</h4>
            <p>
                Conveyancing documents must be signed by either a notary public of the country where the person lives,
                or at the South African Consulate or Embassy in such country.
            </p>
            <h4 style="margin-top: 5%;color: #E69432">Costs to be aware of</h4>
            <p>
                Transfer duty (tax) is payable by the buyer on all pre-owned properties in SA valued at more than R900
                000.
                Transfer duty (tax) is payable by the buyer on all pre-owned properties in SA valued at more than R900
                000. Newly-built properties acquired from developers, on the other hand, usually attract value-added tax
                (VAT) at 14% of value, included in the sale price.

                If the buyer will be letting out the property while they are not in SA, they should be aware that they
                will need a non-residential South African bank account.

            </p>
            <h4 style="margin-top: 5%;color: #E69432">Banking</h4>
            <p>Non-residents can open a local bank account to service instalments on a home loan, or to receive rental
                income from the property they bought.

                Any deposit made into this account in SA will require the approval of the Reserve Bank, because
                non-residents are not allowed to generate any income in SA except for rentals and the interest on
                investments such as shares.

                The following documentation will be required by the banks before they consider a non-resident for bond
                approval:

                - A certified copy of their passport.

                - 3 months’ overseas bank statements.

                - 3 months’ payslips (6 months statements and payslips where the purchaser earns commission or is paid
                overtime).

                You can open a special ‘non-resident’ bank account with a South African Financial Institution and ensure
                that all funds expended for purposes of the property investment go through this account.

                Once the financing details have been finalised, the transfer attorney can go ahead with getting the
                property registered in the new owner's name.
            </p>
            <h4 style="color: #E69432">Financing</h4>
            <p>South African exchange control regulations determine the extent to which foreign buyers can borrow money
                locally to fund the purchase.

                Non-resident purchaser who does not work in South Africa:

                - Non-resident buyer will not be granted more than 50% of the purchase price to fund the purchase.

                - The balance must be paid in cash and this may be cash generated in South Africa, or off-shore funding.

                Non-resident purchaser who is on a temporary work permit in South Africa:

                - May be granted more than 50% of the purchase price, but the loan amount will still depend on the
                bank's criteria.

                - A condition of the loan will be that the buyer reduces the bond to less than 50% of the registered
                amount before they leave South Africa to go back abroad. Some institutions would possibly require a work
                permit of at least four years before they would consider a bond for more than 50% of the purchase price.

                While there might be a short-term gain by paying the seller directly from an overseas account at a
                discounted price, you will not be able to take money back out of the country when selling.
            </p>
            <h4 style="color: #E69432">Cash purchase</h4>
            <p>Money must come into the country via the Reserve Bank, after which a deal receipt showing the exchange
                rate is issued. While there might be a short-term gain by paying the seller directly from an overseas
                account at a discounted price, you will not be able to take money back out of the country when selling.

                Money in a property transaction must go straight to an attorney or estate agent's trust account
                pertaining to the purchase of the property. This is so that there is proof that the money went towards
                the purchase of the property.

                Non-residents who decide to sell their property in SA can repatriate all funds invested, plus any profit
                made on the sale, less Capital Gains Tax (CGT). Keeping detailed receipts of all improvements made to
                the property can be used to write off against any profit made when selling, resulting in paying a lower
                CGT amount.

                The following documentation should be kept by the foreign purchaser to avoid any delays regarding the
                repatriation of funds from the sale of the property:

                - Proof of the derivation of the purchasing funds, including statements on the foreign transferring
                account, as well as the receiving conveyancer's bank statements.

                - A copy of the original sale agreement.

                Upon the eventual sale of the property, application will be made for Exchange Control Approval for the
                repatriation of the funds, supported by the following documents in addition to the documents as set out
                above:

                - Sale agreement (onward sale).

                - Conveyancer’s final statement of account reflecting calculation of the sale proceeds.

                - Foreign bank account information.

                - ID and proof of residence of non-resident.

                Tax implications as a non-resident

                Non-residents who purchase property in South Africa are required to register as South African tax payers
                solely for the purposes of their CGT obligation.

                Foreign buyers have to ensure that they have a South African tax number, and any entity buying or
                selling must also provide a South African tax number. This is not difficult to get, and is easily
                accessed through either the parties' attorney, tax consultant or online.

                At the moment, the highest rate of CGT in South Africa for individuals is 18% of the capital profit.

                There is a withholding tax, whereby when immovable property in South Africa is purchased by any person
                from a non-resident, that purchaser (through the conveyancing attorney) must withhold the required rate
                until clearance is received from the South African Revenue Service (SARS) from any amount to be paid to
                the seller or the seller's agent (tax directives for a lower rate or an exemption can be obtained for
                the withholding tax):

                - 7.5% of the amount payable where the seller is a natural person;

                - 10% of the amount payable where the seller is a company; or

                - 15% of the amount payable where the seller is a trust.

                The above only pertains to properties that sold for more than R2 million. The full proceeds of sale,
                (less any CGT obligation), can be taken out of the country.
            </p>
            <h4 style="color: #E69432">The process</h4>
            <p>Sign the offer > Transfer attorneys receive contract > Bond approval > Receive guarantees from bond
                attorney > Fees and deposits paid > Documents signed > Transfer documents sent to deeds office >
                Transaction is lodged at deeds office > Property registered in new owners name > Seller vacates property
                > Buyer takes occupation > Pay out of any funds needed and close file.

                Hutchison says it is important to contact a reputable real estate agency, whether it be to either sell
                your property to foreign investors, if you yourself are considering investing in SA as an overseas
                visitor, or even if you wish to advise friends and family visiting from abroad on what they would need.

                “We have an international network of shops in over 35 countries, and our sales advisors are trained on
                international standards, ensuring that only the best advice and step-by-step support is given to all our
                clients,” says Hutchison.

            <h3 style="margin-left: 45%; font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;">Ghana</h3>
            <h3>Rental market practice in Ghana is PRO-LANDLORD.</h3>
            <h4>Rents: Can landlord and tenant freely agree rents in Ghana?</h4>
            <p>Rents can be freely negotiated in Ghana. Rent increases are unrestricted.</p>

            <h4 style="color: #E69432">Deposits</h4>
            <p>According to the Rent Act, landlords can only charge 6 months rent in advance,
                and succeeding rents are due every six months; however, in practice,
                landlords charge one to three years rent in advance.
            </p>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 5%;color: #E69432;">What rights do landlords and tenants have in Ghana, especially as
                to duration of contract, and eviction?</h4>
            <p>
                Rental contracts last for the duration of the advance payment, usually one to three years. An option to
                renew can be included in the contract.
                If the tenant wishes to pre-terminate a contract, he must inform the landlord three months in advance.
                In most cases, the tenant must look for someone to take over the lease for the duration of the contract,
                or wait for the repayment since the landlord may have invested or spent the money already.
                The Rent Act was passed to protect the tenants from frequent evictions by the landlord, especially when
                the former are not able to cope with incremental rent increases. Under this law, a tenant is usually
                given time, usually three months, to find a suitable place to relocate before being asked to leave. He
                can only be ordered by the court to vacate the premises immediately if the landlord has demonstrated
                that the property is required for his or his immediate family’s personal use or that he wants to remodel
                and renovate. But even then, the tenant must still be given time to find a suitable place.

            </p>
            <h4 style="margin-top: 5%;color: #E69432">How effective is the Ghanaian legal system?</h4>
            <p>
                Evictions can be a problem in Ghana, especially when dealing with low-income tenants.
                The Rent Control Department is the primary authority responsible for resolving disputes
                between landlords, tenants, and other persons with interests in premises. However,
                this Department is notorious for its inefficiency and corruption in years past.
            </p>
            <p>To evict tenants faster, the landlord can bribe the Rent Control Officer and his staff to ensure that
                your papers will be processed faster and to get a favorable decision. This is not guaranteed because
                some tenants would rather “counter bribe” the Rent Control Officer than pay rent. If the landlord is
                unwilling to pay the bribe, his case will most likely be referred to the court after waiting a long time
                for a decision from the Department.
                Another option is for the landlord to hire macho men and local hoodlums to scare away non-paying

            <h3 style="margin-left: 45%; font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;">Ethiopia</h3>

            <p>The Ethiopian real-estate market continues to defy all odds, and its growth trajectory still points
                upwards.</p>


            <p>As much as builders seem to be firing on all engines, home ownership in Ethiopia remains extremely low
                where the sharp supply and demand disparity is forcing an upward pressure on prices for all types of
                homes.
                There is a large number of builders in Ethiopia with varying target market focus. In general, home
                builders can be classified into three main categories with the government and other low cost home
                builders leading the way in building hundreds of thousands of affordable housing that has made a very
                significant number of citizens first time homeowners.
                These homes are what are traditionally known as “condominiums” whose sizes vary from a bachelor studio
                apartment to a 3 bedroom family dwelling. The prices as well as rental incomes of these homes vary based
                on location and size.
            </p>


            <h4 style="margin-top: 5%;color: #E69432;">What rights do landlords and tenants have in Ghana, especially as
                to duration of contract, and eviction?</h4>
            <p>
                Rental contracts last for the duration of the advance payment, usually one to three years. An option to
                renew can be included in the contract.
                If the tenant wishes to pre-terminate a contract, he must inform the landlord three months in advance.
                In most cases, the tenant must look for someone to take over the lease for the duration of the contract,
                or wait for the repayment since the landlord may have invested or spent the money already.
                The Rent Act was passed to protect the tenants from frequent evictions by the landlord, especially when
                the former are not able to cope with incremental rent increases. Under this law, a tenant is usually
                given time, usually three months, to find a suitable place to relocate before being asked to leave. He
                can only be ordered by the court to vacate the premises immediately if the landlord has demonstrated
                that the property is required for his or his immediate family’s personal use or that he wants to remodel
                and renovate. But even then, the tenant must still be given time to find a suitable place.

            </p>
            <p>For example, a 43 Sq.m studio apartment in the center of Addis currently commands an asking price of
                700,000 ETB, and it can fetch up-to 6,000 Birr per month in rental income.
                Moving up the price ladder are homes from private builders typically catering to clients in the middle
                income market segment with current prices ranging from a two bedroom with a price tag of 2,000,000 ETB
                all the way up to about 3,500,000 ETB.
                For buyers with more exquisite taste and the added gusto for location, new and experienced foreign
                builders lead by Chinese companies offer apartments in best locations with a surrounding geared for more
                posh lifestyle. Prices for these properties range from 3,500,000 ETB to 5,000,000 ETB
                Buyers willing to shell out more money for gated community type lifestyle can choose from a large number
                of builders who cater to this segment. Prices start at about 8,000,000 ETB, and some of the houses have
                a private compound up-to 1000 Sq.m.

            </p>
            <h4 style="margin-top: 5%;color: #E69432">Who is eligible to buy property in Ethiopia?</h4>
            <p>
                Ethiopian citizens and Ethiopian citizens who live abroad,Foreign nationals of Ethiopian origin,People
                with Ethiopian parents.
                However,It's not so cut and dry. Under normal circumstances a foreigner is not permitted to buy land. If
                a foreigner is an investor they may own property in the name of the company. All investors have rights
                to residency under the law and therefore can buy and lease property. Property may also be granted by the
                government depending on the business' needs. However in order to become an investor they must show
                capital of at least $100,000US with a bank statement. Land may also be gifted to a foreigner but no
                title (cart and plan) may be issued

        <!--China-->
        <div class="SouthAfrica" id="Chinaflag" style="display:none;border-top: 2px solid #245269">

            <h3 style="margin-left: 45%; font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;">China</h3>
            <p>When looking for property to purchase in China, it is important to take your time to consider all
                available options. Consider sitting down and writing a list of the features or characteristics of the
                home that you would like to buy. In addition, research the area where the property is located and find
                out the going rate for other similar properties.
                There are many types of properties for sale in China, ranging from one-bedroom apartments to five
                bedroom bungalows, which is why it is important to determine what you want before you start your search.
                Currently, China does not have many restrictions on the type of property that expats can purchase. You
                can purchase a home from developers, agents or directly from the owners.

                Buying property is a huge investment, no matter where you live. Therefore, it is important to carefully
                do your homework before you invest in the Chinese property market. The government requires all property
                owners to pay taxes on top of the actual costs of their homes. You may be required to pay three percent
                stamp duty, two percent maintenance tax, 1.5 percent contract tax, and 0.1 percent stamp duty for
                property resale.
                Factor in all the costs that will be incurred in the house purchase, determine the characteristics of
                your desired home, and research the location of the target property to make the house-hunting process as
                smooth as possible, and to find your dream home quickly.

                Research is key to buying property in China. The more time you invest in shopping around, the better.
                You can use various tools to help you in your search including local newspapers, magazines, online
                property sites and classified listings among others.

                China has many real estate agents that you can contact to help you find your dream home. Most of the
                agents have offices and may provide newsletters that show recently listed properties. One of the
                advantages of working with an agent is that they will provide you with a good idea of the current
                housing market as well as relevant information regarding the area you are interested in. In addition,
                English-speaking property agents can help you negotiate with property owners.

                There are many newspapers and magazines that provide property listings as well as information regarding
                prices and market trends. Many prospective homebuyers prefer to use magazines when searching for
                properties for sale, because they provide an in-depth look of the Chinese real estate market as well as
                detailed graphs, diagrams and images of properties for sale.

                The internet is one of the most helpful property search resources. A significant advantage of the
                internet is that it allows you to use multiple channels and resources to find the type of property you
                want. Through the internet, you can find property and market information, contact property agents or
                agencies and register for a newsletter. This resource allows you to find everything you need without
                leaving the comfort of your home.

                Attending property shows allows you to see multiple properties sponsored by different agencies in one
                place. Real estate agencies in China usually hold property shows throughout the year. Some of the most
                popular property shows in China include the Beijing International Property Expo, which occurs from June
                28 to July 1, the Shanghai Green Roof and Wall & Building Greening Exhibition, which takes place between
                June 29 and July 1.

            </p>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 5%;color: #E69432;">Property Market Customs</h4>
            <p>
                The Chinese real estate market is quite different from those of Western nations. Therefore,
                it is important to understand how things work in the country before you invest in the property market.
                Once you purchase a house in China, the title of ownership is yours, but the land on which the property
                stands still belongs to the government. What you are doing is simply renting the land.

            </p>
            <p>Something else to bear in mind when buying property in China is the fast pace of the Chinese real estate
                market. This is because that many people in China pay for property purchases in cash. People hardly use
                loans and mortgages, making the process much faster.

                There are some extra costs that come with property purchases in China. Getting a loan in China as an
                expat can be tedious and time consuming. In addition, owing property in China does not give you the
                right to residency. It is a good idea to check the current visa policy before investing in the Chinese
                property market.

            </p>
            <h4 style="margin-top: 5%;color: #E69432">Making An Offer</h4>
            <p>
                Buying property in China can be a long and tedious process if not properly undertaken. Research the
                rules and regulations carefully as they can change quite fast. Consider working with a lawyer or real
                estate agent to provide you with valuable information about what is expected from you and the
                requirements for a property purchase.

                Once you find a property that meets your needs and specifications, you can make an offer. An offer is
                usually made in the form of a letter, with details of the price and other conditions that you should be
                met. The offer is usually accompanied with a deposit, which is often one percent or more of the sales
                price. The deposit proves to the owner that you are serious about the property purchase.

            </p>

            <p>
                Once the owner accepts your offer, the next step would involve making certain financial arrangements.
                Whether you decide to pay for the property through a mortgage, check or cash,
                the public security bureau or real estate agent will have to approve the payment beforehand.
                You may be required to pay at least 30 percent of the value of the property, as well as taxes and other
                fees when signing your property purchase contract. In addition, the contract must be notarized after
                signing by both parties.
                The deed is transferred to the buyer once you finish paying all the fees and both parties have signed
                the contract.
                You will be required to pay the remaining cost of the property after the transfer of the property deed.
                The property belongs to the buyer once they finish paying for it and has the deed signed over to them.

                apartment building, provided that the building has obtained a ‘strata title’, which generally applies to
                new condominiums buildings.

                Foreigners are not allow to own properties on the ground floor of a building as owning land outright
                remains prohibited under the foreign ownership property law.

                Hence, foreigners are 100% eligible to own a freehold condominium in Cambodia.

                But if your intention is to invest in real property such as buying ground floor apartments or land in
                Cambodia, please read here.

        <div class="SouthAfrica" id="Thailandflag" style="display:none;border-top: 2px solid #245269">

            <h3 style="margin-left: 45%; font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;">Thailand</h3>
            <h4>Legal restrictions
                Can foreigners buy property in Thailand?
            </h4>
            <h4>Thailand - Property</h4>
            <p>
                Foreigners are not allowed to own land in Thailand by law. If interested in buying,
                a foreign investor has two options: either a 30-year leasehold or purchasing the property through a
                limited company.
                Apartments can be purchased by foreigners as long as at least 51% of the building is owned by Thais.
                Due to the legal restrictions in the Thai property market, many foreigners look for alternatives to a
                direct property purchase,
                some of which are outlined below.
            </p>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 5%;color: #E69432;">Leasing land in Thailand</h4>
            <p>
                A foreigner can lease land for 30 years in Thailand. However, leasing is rather unusual, in most cases
                this occurs when a foreign man marries a Thai woman: the Thai woman, as a Thai citizen, purchases the
                land and stipulates a lease agreement with her foreign husband.

                No matter who you lease from, make sure that all data on the deed is accurate, and that the land you are
                leasing has the appropriate title. Usually, the leasing contract states the duration of the lease, the
                buyer´s right to resell it and the registration fee.

            </p>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 5%;color: #E69432;"> Land titles</h4>
            <p>
                Land can have different titles in Thailand, depending on factors such as the location or whether it can
                be leased to a foreigner or not. There are seven types of land titles but just three of them can be
                leased: Chanot, Nor Sor Saam Gor and Nor Sor Saam.

            </p>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 5%;color: #E69432;"> Purchasing land through a company</h4>
            <p>
                Another alternative, is to set up a Thai Limited Company. If you decide this is the best option for you,
                be aware that as a foreigner, you cannot hold half or more than half of the company's shares. Therefore
                the company has to be at least 51% owned by Thai citizen. They can then choose to sign over their
                company rights to you. Note, that the Thai Immigration office is aware of this kind of procedures and
                will certainly monitor your business.


            </p>

            <h4 style="margin-top: 5%;color: #E69432;"> Buying an apartment as a foreigner</h4>
            <p>
                Due to the legal restrictions mentioned above, most foreigners choose to simply buy a condominium or
                apartment in Thailand. However, a foreigner can only purchase a condominium in his/her own name, as long
                as at least 51% of the building is owned by Thai people.

            <h4>CAN A FOREIGNER PURCHASE PROPERTY IN JAPAN?</h4>

            <p>
                Yes, provided you have the cash or finance. Unlike many other countries,
                there are currently no laws or regulations in Japan that prohibit or control the purchase of Japanese
                real estate by foreigners.
                There are no restrictions over residency or visa status. In fact, you can even buy and own Japanese real
                estate without ever having
                visited the country (although it is not recommended to purchase sight unseen).
            </p>


            <p>
                Your ability to obtain a home loan from a Japanese financial institution, however, will require you to
                be a resident of Japan with proof of income.
            </p>


            <p>
                Property titles can be registered to a foreign address so no matter where you reside, you are able to
                buy and sell land, forestry, homes, apartments, golf courses, private islands, apartments or entire
                buildings in Japan.

                Purchasing and owning real estate in Japan will not make you eligible for a residence permit.

                There has been increasing debate over restricting land ownership to foreigners, but these discussions
                are usually referring to purchasing land in areas that may be of importance to national security. For
                example, land adjoining military bases, or large tracts of forest that contain natural water sources.

            <p>One of the many decisions older adults must make is where to settle down during retirement.
                While most Americans stay in the U.S., a small number of adventurous people move overseas
                – at least on a part-time basis – to enjoy new experiences, a better climate and the possibility of
                a lower cost of living. There’s another reason to move abroad: family roots – if, for instance,
                you were born abroad or your parents hail from outside the U.S. In this article we look at what's
                involved
                if your heritage lies in South Korea. </p>

            <h4>Receiving Your Social Security Benefits</h4>

            <p>
                As long as you are eligible for Social Security payments, you can receive them while living in South
                Korea, no matter how long you are out of your country and regardless of which nations you are a citizen
                of (South Korea is one of the countries with which countries such the U.S. has a Social Security
                Totalization Agreement). Use the Social Security Administration’s Payments Abroad Screening Tool for
                details pertaining to your specific situation.

                According to the Social Security Administration, you can opt to have your benefits mailed to your
                address in South Korea or deposited directly into the bank account or other financial institution of
                your choice – in South Korea or the U.S. (or in any country that participates in the Social Security
                Administration’s International Direct Deposit program).

            </p>

            <h4>Laws Regarding Land Ownership</h4>

            <p>
                Due to high housing costs, many foreigners living in South Korea choose to rent instead of buy. That
                being said, foreigners are permitted to purchase real estate, a privilege not possible in every country.
                Resident foreigners who want to buy property in South Korea are, however, subject to the Foreigner’s
                Land Acquisition Act and the Registration of Real Estate Act. The transaction must be reported to the
                appropriate district office within 60 days of signing the purchase contract, and both the property
                purchase contract and a certified copy of the property registration must be submitted.

                Non-resident foreigners are subject to the Foreigner’s Land Acquisition Act, the Registration of Real
                Estate Act and the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act. The same reporting requirements as above apply,
                plus non-residents bringing capital into South Korea to buy property must report the transaction to a
                foreign exchange bank. This is done by submitting a copy of the appraisal report, property contract and
                a certified copy of the property registration.

            </p>

            <h4>Dual Citizenship and Visas</h4>
            <p>
                Since the amended Nationality Act went into effect on Jan. 1, 2011, South Korea has recognized permanent
                dual citizenship of its nationals who satisfy eligibility requirements under the act. The amended act
                allows anyone holding dual citizenship by birth (for example, if you were born in the U.S. to South
                Korean parents) to hold both citizenships by submitting a pledge to the Minister of Justice. If your
                conduct in some way dishonors the pledge, you may be forced to choose one nationality.

                If you do not have South Korean citizenship and wish to stay in the country, you have a few visa
                options. One is the three-month tourism visa, which allows you to stay in South Korea for up to 90 days
                at a time and can be renewed at the border. Another option is the D8 Investment Visa, obtainable if you
                invest at least 100 million won (about $92,500 as of 2018) in local businesses inside the country. If
                you invest more than $500,000 in South Korea, you may be eligible for permanent residency. For those who
                can afford the initial investment, this option is the easiest way to obtain residency in South Korea.
                (For more, see Retire in South Korea With $200,000 of Savings?)

                U.S. citizens traveling or living abroad are encouraged to enroll in the Department of State’s Smart

            <h4>Taxes</h4>
            <p>Residents (regardless of nationality) are subject to South Korean income tax on income earned worldwide;
                non-residents are taxed only on South Korean–sourced income. You are considered a resident if you have
                lived in South Korea for at least one year or if you have a job that would generally require you to live
                in Korea for more than a year.

                Because the U.S. and South Korea have a Double Taxation Agreement in place, you won’t be taxed twice on
                the same income. You’ll generally file a return in both countries, but you can use offsetting tax
                credits that essentially limit your tax burden to one country. Tax laws are complicated and change
                frequently, so it is recommended that you work with a qualified accountant to make sure you have the
                most favorable outcome possible.

            <h4>The Bottom Line</h4>
            <p>Any move overseas takes a lot of planning for logistics, such as how you’ll receive your federal benefits
                and what type of visa you’ll need.
                Aside from these types of details, it’s important to think realistically about what living in a foreign
                country will be like,
                even with family ties there. While some older adults enjoy the adventure, others find it pushes them too
                far beyond their comfort zones.
                In these instances living abroad on a part-time basis may be a good option. If you have a choice when it
                comes to moving abroad,
                it’s a good idea to give careful consideration to your own situation, comfort level, friends, family and
                healthcare needs before making any decisions.</p>

            <h3 style="margin-left: 45%; font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;">France</h3>
            <p>Whether you’re moving to France for work, to start a business or just to enjoy the French lifestyle,
                you’ve probably considered buying property to live in or as an investment.

                Whether your destination of choice is Paris, Marseilles, Lyon or any smaller city in between, you’ll
                find a plethora of options in property for sale, ranging from massive estates to tiny apartments to
                undeveloped plots of land.

                While it seems like the French are missing out on investing in their own country-- just 57% own their
                own property-- their reluctance to buy has left a wide market open for expats and foreign investors. And
                despite some tricky laws and a load of taxes, many non-Residents have taken the opportunity to buy into
                the European country.

                So if you’ve decided to buy property, what should you know in advance? This guide will walk you through
                the steps and key points for buying property in France.
            </p>

            <h4>What’s the property market like in France?</h4>

            <p>
                At the moment the French property market is in the middle of a steady incline, and has been over the
                past two years. The price of housing has increased by as much as 8%, depending on the home type and
                location.

                Despite a major dip in 2009 and again in 2013, France’s housing market is generally seen as relatively
                strong, as the country boasts a wealth of desirable property for investors and vacationers.

                That being said, many French people choose to rent instead of buy. This is typically credited to massive
                home prices, which in Paris have peaked to about €8,000 per square meter in the past few years. Most
                young families simply can’t afford to purchase property in the cities, and-- as is true nearly
                anywhere-- are unwilling to sacrifice their urban lifestyle in exchange for the relatively less
                expensive cost of property in more rural areas. All in all, when you consider renting vs. buying in
                France there are distinct advantages to each, and depending on your financial standing and intent for
                the property the right answer is different from person to person.

            </p>

            <h4>Can foreigners buy property in France?</h4>

            <p>
                Yes-- there are currently no restrictions on foreigners buying property in France, however you may find
                the process a bit more difficult as a foreigner.

                If you’re working with a real estate agent the process is likely to be relatively straightforward
                regardless. If you’re buying directly from the owner, however, you may find your price is inflated, even
                up to twice the cost of what might be offered to a French person. As such, it’s a good idea to engage a
                local friend to help you with the process if you can, as they’re likely to have a better rappeur and get
                a nicer deal from a fellow Frenchman or woman.

            </p>

            <h4>What’s the approximate cost of different properties in France?</h4>
            <p>
                The cost of property in France ranges significantly based on the type of property and where it is. The
                following table can give you an idea of what costs might be in select areas, but you can find a wide
                range of variation and should be prepared to do plenty of research into prices in your chosen locale.

            <p>When you’ve chosen the mortgage product that works best for you, you’ll need to make your application.
                Typically this will mean that you have to arrange a stack of paperwork, and visit the If you’re
                considering buying a property in Germany, you’ll have a choice of life in a large metropolitan city, a
                stately historic town or a more rural setting entirely. If you’re planning on a move to Germany, you
                might be thinking of joining the 3.6 million inhabitants living in Germany’s capital Berlin, dreaming of
                historic Hamburg or maybe even planning on Munich, the German city with the highest quality of life.

                Of course, city life might not be your thing. Luckily, there’s a huge choice of smaller towns, many of
                which have excellent transport and commuter links to the large cities. Residents get the best of all
                worlds, with easy access to the facilities of the city, the community feel of living in a smaller town
                and the peace of the surrounding German countryside.

                There are relatively low homeownership rates in Germany, with just over half the population preferring
                to buy rather than rent. However, historically low interest rates mean that more and more Germans have
                now decided that this is the right time to invest in a property. If you’re thinking of doing the same,
                then you’ll need to know a bit about how the process of buying a home in Germany as an expat will work.
                Here’s a quick guide.
            </p>

            <h4>What’s the property market like in Germany?</h4>

            <p>
                In 2014, only around 52% of Germans owned their own homes, with the rest preferring to rent. Home
                ownership in Europe runs at nearly 70%, giving Germany one of the lowest figures in the EU. However,
                this has started to shift significantly over recent years. Historically low interest rates have caused
                more people to opt to buy a house, rather than watch their savings eroded by inflation.

                Germany was also relatively unaffected by the housing crash which hit most of Europe and North America
                in the late 2000s. Because of that, property here has been seen as a stable investment for overseas
                investors for some time.

                The sharp jump in people choosing to buy property has pushed prices up. In 2015, house prices were up
                5.8% and in 2016, they shot up again by a further 8%. 2017 shows no sign of being any different,
                prompting heated debate about how sustainable the level of increases are.

                House price rises are affected by local market forces, such as the availability of housing stock, and
                changes in the demographics. This means that the steep increases haven’t been across the board in
                Germany. In the first half of 2016, for example, prices actually fell in Dortmund by 3%, and the cities
                of Dresden and Hamburg saw only modest increases of under 2%. On the other hand, the southern German
                cities of Munich and Stuttgart experienced price increases of around 10% year on year.

                Where house prices are rising, often so are rents. Again, in some places this is a hot political issue.
                Renting in Berlin, in particular, has come under intense scrutiny recently, as steep rises in rental
                costs have made it difficult for people to afford their homes.

            </p>

            <h4>Can foreigners buy property in Germany?</h4>

            <p>
                There are no special requirements nor paperwork for foreigners wishing to buy property in Germany, so
                you shouldn’t have any issues.

                What’s the approximate cost of different properties in Germany?
                If you’re thinking of buying a property in Germany, the price you pay will be influenced significantly
                by where you want to live. As this table shows, location really matters, with a reasonably large Munich
                flat costing some €400,000 more than the same property in Frankfurt.

            <p>Expats looking to buy property in the UK will find that property is generally considered to be costly,
                more so than in other countries. Yet despite this, the demand has not dropped. In London, unlike other
                cities where house prices have declined during the recent banking crisis, prime London property exists
                in its own bubble with prices having jumped between four and six percent over the past year.

                Property in London is in short supply, which has enabled property prices to remain extremley high.

                Despite the UK having been in a double-dip recession and mortgages being more difficult to secure, the
                current economic climate presents good buying opportunities for those acquiring property outside of the
                capital and not needing a large mortgage. Unfortunately, this has resulted in greater demand which has
                caused property prices to surge globally during the past few years, starting with Russia and then more
                recently China, and more consistently, Europe.

                As the Eurozone lurches from crisis to crisis, the number of wealthy European property buyers in London
                has surged. Greeks, Italians, Spaniards and the French are converting their Euros into bricks and
                mortar, predominantly in London.

            <p>Foreigners are able to buy property in the UK and most nationalities are eligible for investment loans,
                although there are fewer banks offering them. Those living abroad will require proof of income and may
                be asked to pay up to a 40 percent deposit. Mortgage rates currently vary between three and five percent
                and
                the type of mortgage available will depend upon its intended use. Foreigners can often secure loans in
                their
                own country as they may already have established assets they can charge against and have mature
                relationships with
                their existing banks. It is wise to investigate the tax implications when considering such a loan.</p>

            <h4>Steps to purchasing property in the UK</h4>

            <p>
                The first thing expats need to do is to set a budget and, if a mortgage is needed, make the necessary
                arrangements.
                Expats will need to secure the services of a conveyance solicitor.
                Once a buyer has decided on a property and made a verbal offer to the vendor’s agent that has been
                accepted, the agent will submit the offer to both solicitors via the Memorandum of Sale (a buyer could
                do this themselves if the seller allows it; however, mortgage providers may require both parties to be
                professionally represented).
                The seller’s solicitor will contact the buyer's solicitor and provide them with a copy of the seller’s
                title. The buyer's solicitor will then raise enquiries on the title and all other matters that he or she
                considers relevant. The solicitor will also request a list of fixtures and fittings so that the buyer
                can be told what is to be included in the sale. The solicitor will also put in hand all the usual local
                searches.
                Mortgage offers tend to be slower (most mortgages come through within about five weeks of an application
                being submitted).
                The above work is part of the pre-exchange of contracts, that is, neither the seller nor the buyer is
                committed in any way and either party can still withdraw from the transaction.

                Once the work is done and any necessary mortgage offer has been received by the buyer, the solicitors
                will discuss the completion dates required by their clients. Once this is agreed and all parties are
                ready to proceed, there will then be an exchange of solicitors’ contacts. Expats will be asked to pay 10
                percent of the purchase price at exchange of contracts and once contracts are exchanged there is a
                binding contract between the parties and neither party can withdraw.

                If a person decides to withdraw as a purchaser after exchange of contracts they will lose ther deposit
                and the seller can then also sue for any subsequent losses they may suffer. It is therefore very
                important that the buyer does not exchange contracts until they are satisfied with the property and able
                to proceed financially. The balance of the purchase price and any other fees are paid by the solicitor
                on completion, so expats will need to provide these monies to their solicitor a short time before
                completion.

                On the date of completion the solicitor will arrange to settle the remaining sum for the property and
                then register the title at the Land Registry and send the buyer evidence of registration.

                Thereafter, the property belongs to the new owner and they can take possession of the keys.

            <h4>Conveyancing</h4>

            <p>
                The legal process for buying a property.
            </p>

            <h4>Freehold</h4>

            <p>
                An individual owns the land and property completely, and is therefore responsible for all maintenance
                and repairs.
            </p>
            <h4>Leasehold</h4>

            <p>
                Much of the property in London is leasehold. This applies to nearly all apartments in London and some
                houses. In general terms, the reason property is leasehold is that there is an area of communality where
                various people effectively live under the same roof and therefore have to contribute towards the costs
                of repairing the roof and structure of the building and any communal areas.

                This is particularly obvious where someone is purchasing an apartment. Lease terms vary but nowadays
                most new leases seem to be granted for about 125 years, but it is very important that expats find out
                from the agent the remaining term of the lease they are buying and discuss the same with their solicitor
                as he/she will be able to advise on whether or not the term is long enough.

                Recent legislation has increased the rights of leaseholders, enabling them in some situations to
                collectively buy the freehold of their block of apartments or individually purchase an extension to the
                original lease. A solicitor will need to advise on this if this is relevant.

            </p>

            <h4>Gazump</h4>

            <p>
                A legal situation that can arise when the seller (vendor) has accepted an offer and is subsequently
                offered a higher price by another party and accepts it. Ways to avoid this are to ask the agent to
                remove the property from the market at the time of making the offer or to put down an immediate
                non-refundable deposit at the time of acceptance of the offer from the vendor.
            </p>
            <h4>Gazund</h4>

            <p>
                The buyer can reduce an offer at the time of exchange of contracts in the hopes that the seller will
                accept the lower offer. This is also legal but not encouraged as the buyer risks losing the property if
                the vendor refuses.

                How to find property for sale in the UK
            </h4>

            <p>
                Most properties are advertised online. Information will include details of the real estate agencies,
                which also have independent websites.
                Estate agencies will have local neighbourhood magazines that showcase properties and other general
                information in the area.
                Newspapers all over the country also have property sections, some on certain days of the week.
                Properties are auctioned and notices of these placed in magazines and newspapers. Agents can inform
                buyers of these.
                Independent property finders in London, such as Property Personal Shopper, are an efficient and time
                saving means of sourcing property, particularly for people who are not conversant with the UK purchasing
                process, have limited leisure time or are not familiar with the areas involved. One of the main
                advantages of using such services is that property finders are retained by their clients and so pose no
                threat to the agents who give them access to properties not on the open market, this is of invaluable
                benefit to buyers.

            <h4>PURCHASE A HOME IN THE U.S.</h4>
            <p>The term "global marketplace" has never been more descriptive - particularly when it comes to real
                estate.

                According to the National Association of Realtors, international buyers purchased more than $68.2
                billion in U.S. residential real estate from March 2012 to March 2013, across all 50 states. Property
                sales in the United States to foreign buyers amount to more than 6 percent of total U.S. home sales in
                value.

                Whether you're an international investor, a Canadian snowbird or a first-generation immigrant living in
                the United States, purchasing in an unfamiliar market can be daunting. While this guide will help you
                get started, it is no substitute for the expertise of experienced real estate agents, attorneys,
                mortgage brokers and accountants you will want to consult along the way.
            </p>
            <h4>HOW THE PROPERTY WILL BE USED</h4>
            <p>Before you start your property search, it's important to think ahead to how you'll use the home once the
                deal is done.

                Will this be a vacation home?
                A home to stay in while doing business in the United States?
                A home for your children while they attend college in the States?
                An investment?
                An eventual long-term residence?

                SIMPLY BUYING REAL ESTATE in the United States does not give foreign owners any rights or privileges
                regarding legal stay or status. If you're interested in staying in the states longer than allowed by a
                standard visa, contact an immigration lawyer.

                By determining the primary use for your property and how long you plan to own it, you'll be able to
                provide information to your real estate agent that will help guide the search and sale.

            <h4>HE U.S.REAL ESTATE MARKET WORKS</h4>

            <p>
                The way U.S. real estate transactions are carried out may differ from your home country. EACH STATE IN
                THE UNITED STATES has its own set of rules regarding the purchase of real estate, including the type of
                purchase contract used, the method of closing the sale and even the duties and titles of the individuals
                involved.

                Several important U.S. real estate practices worth noting:
                In the United States, real estate listing information is shared by agents using multiple listing
                services and consumers can access that same information using real estate sites such as Baoyunju
                International Real Estate and Construction. In many other parts of the world, real estate is a
                fragmented business and buyers have to go from agent to agent to find a property.
                In some countries, it is typical to pay a fee to the agents who are scouting properties on your behalf
                and showing you around. In the United States, the sales commission is paid by the seller, so buyers
                don't pay anything to have an agent work on their behalf.
                In the United States, real estate agents need licenses to operate. The licensing laws of each state
                differ regarding how much education is required, the type and depth of licensing examinations, and
                whether continuing education courses are required once an agent becomes licensed. The licensing system
                was designed to ensure real estate agents are qualified to guide consumers through the maze of finding,
                evaluating and financing real estate. Many other countries like Costa Rica, Mexico, El Salvador and
                Belize do not require real estate agents to be licensed.
                Foreign buyers will also want to give consideration to issues such as currency exchange rates,
                international wire transfers, banking systems, multi-national taxation and accounting issues, and
                import/export restrictions regarding currency and household goods.
                Taking the time to learn how to convert from U.S. dollars into your native currency will simplify your
                shopping experience. Review the latest currency exchange rates. IF MATH ISN'T YOUR THING, download a
                good currency converter app like Converter+ to do the work for you.
                LOCAL REAL ESTATE PROFESSIONALS
                Foreign buyers, in particular, should take the time to find qualified and experienced professionals to
                walk you through the real estate purchasing process. Agents who have taken additional coursework may
                carry the Certified International Property Specialist (CIPS) Designation.

                IF YOU'RE NOT FLUENT IN ENGLISH, or prefer speaking in your native language, choose agents, attorneys,
                inspectors and bankers who are conversant in your native language. While it may be possible to get
                translated copies of standard real estate documents, it's likely that you will have to sign the English
                versions when it comes time to close the deal.

                Assembling a qualified team will take some time - ask associates for referrals, do website searches,
                find locals in real estate directories and check references. In the end, the expertise these
                professionals bring should make the experience less stressful for you.

            </p>

            <h4>FINANCING</h4>

            <p>
                Qualified foreign buyers with a 30 to 40 percent down payment can often obtain financing for their U.S.
                real estate purchases. MANY BANKS REQUIRE FOREIGN BUYERS to have a specific amount ($100,000 or more) on
                deposit with the bank while others set loan limits of $1 million to $2 million. You may also be required
                to present a minimum of three months of bank statements.

                The U.S. home loan market offers an array of safe, affordable mortgages, including some that will allow
                Muslims to buy a home without violating Islamic laws against paying interest.

                Before applying for a U.S. mortgage, you must first establish credit and earn a good credit score. You
                can start building your credit score by opening U.S. bank and credit card accounts. You'll also want to
                be sure to report all income on your tax returns. Lenders use this income information to determine how
                much money they're willing to loan you to buy a home.
                When the time comes to apply for a mortgage, consider major banks with global operations. These lenders
                will have the experience necessary to verify credit established in other countries and to guide you
                through the U.S. home-buying process.

            <p>Buying a house does not increase chances of entry, but nor does it hurt. The purchase of a home certainly
                shows a connection to Canada and the home is ultimately treated as a part of the overall net worth of

                process.

                Buying a business, however, could result in a faster entry into Canada based on a temporary work permit.
                CAUTION! Buying a business must be part of a comprehensive immigration strategy. The purchase must be
                strategized with other qualifying factors, such as overall asset base, the projected performance of the
                business and previous business experience. These important aspects are examined and must be approved by
                the provincial government and/or the federal immigration department before any business is purchased. It
                is best to obtain legal advice before buying a home or business.
            </p>
            <h4> As a foreigner can I get a mortgage?</h4>
            <p>The answer is yes. The requirements for obtaining a mortgage to finance a purchase, whether a home or a
                business, will depend on the institution with which you will do business. Generally speaking, there is
                no problem in securing mortgages with more-established financial institutions. These institutions will
                usually require a letter of introduction from the previous banking facility with which you have done
                business in your home country. Previous income in the home country will also be verified. Also,
                institutions may require a greater percentage of the purchase price as a down payment.</p>
            <h4>How long can I stay in Canada? (Can't I just go out for a day and come back?)</h4>

            <p>
                Generally, a person is allowed a six month entry as a visitor. If a second home is purchased,
                one can bring in a reasonable amount of furniture as a "seasonal resident" without paying any duty.
                There is no corresponding regulation in the immigration act (IRPA) that states the person has to leave
                for six months before returning,
                so multiple entries can be allowed. CAUTION! You cannot "flagpole" continuously. Flagpoling means
                leaving Canada for a few days and then
                returning to Canada. Although such re-entry may be allowed on one or two occasions, the person does run
                a risk of being refused entry
                into Canada because he or she is living in Canada as a resident under the guise of being a visitor.
                The foreign national must maintain substantial roots with his or her home country. Click here for more
                details on flagpoling.
            </p>

            <h4> If I rent out my home, what are the tax implications?</h4>

            <p>
                Occasionally, foreign nationals will purchase a home, reside in it for a few months of the year and rent
                it out for the balance.
                NOTE: Special tax rules do apply to such situations and Canadian tax returns must be filed by the
                foreigner. In fact,
                if the taxation payments are not set up properly, the foreign landlord will be required to pay 25% of
                the rental income
                per month to the tax department as a holdback until the tax returns are filed. However, such a drastic
                reduction of rent
                can be avoided if you appoint a Canadian resident to make the filings on your behalf at the end of the
                year. CAUTION!
                When selling a residence, you must file a clearance certificate well in advance of the sale or there can
                be up to a 25% holdback
                of the full selling price until the clearance certificate is obtained from the tax department.
            </p>
            <h4> Can I retire in Canada?</h4>
            <p>There is no retirement category under the immigration regulations. Such an avenue did once exist, but the
                retirement avenue of immigration was phased out in the late 1980s.

                If an individual is buying a home with the view of ultimately retiring here, it is important to seek
                legal immigration advice immediately.

                Qualifying for immigration is time sensitive in that points are awarded based on the number of years of
                experience in both business and in work as well as the age factor. It is important that as soon as
                individuals are considering purchasing a home here in Canada that they seek immediate immigration legal
                advice to ensure that a proper strategy exists for the potential permanent entry in the future. There
                are also health and age-related questions which may impact the admissibility.

            <h3 style="margin-left: 45%; font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;">Australia </h3>

            <p>Foreign investment in Australian property has been a controversial topic in recent years. Surging house
                prices in Australian capital cities, particularly in Sydney, has seen concerns about domestic and
                foreign investors buying multiple properties. While it’s feasible for overseas residents to buy for
                investment purposes, the regulations for buying a home to live in are a little more complex.
                There are countless thousands of Australians without official residency status whose are citizens in all
                but name; likewise, there are many more people living overseas who regularly visit Australia to see
                family and friends. For these people who are more Aussie than Vegemite, buying a home in Australia is
                often a very useful thing, even if you’re not officially a citizen.

                So can a non-permanent resident buy a house? And if you can, is it a good idea?
            </p>
            <h4> Can a non-resident buy a house in Australia?</h4>
            <p>Yes, but conditions do apply. In order to purchase residential real estate in Australia – whether you
                want to live in it or use it as an investment property – non-residents need to apply to the Foreign
                Investment Review Board (FIRB) for permission.

                As a part of the federal government, the FIRB is responsible for ensuring most foreign investment in
                Australia is directed towards new dwellings, which create new jobs and result in economic growth, as
                well as preserving the current stock of housing in Australia for purchase by local residents.

                All foreign citizens need to apply for approval before taking an interest in any residential real
                estate; the only exceptions are New Zealand citizens, Australian permanent residents, and their spouses.

                If you’re looking to purchase a new dwelling or vacant land, the news is good – most of these
                applications are approved, due to the fact that they encourage new housing development. The only
                condition is that construction on land must be completed within 4 years from the date of purchase.

                If you’re looking to buy an established dwelling (i.e. an existing house), then, unfortunately, the news
                isn’t so good. Non-resident foreign citizens are generally prohibited from buying existing properties in
                Australia, the reasoning being that it deprives Australian buyers of a property they could buy and live
                in.

                That said, there are several cases in which you could be approved to buy an established dwelling:

                Temporary residents can apply to purchase a home to reside in while leaving in Australia. This is
                usually conditional on you selling the home once you leave Australia, or on becoming a permanent
                resident or citizen later on. Unfortunately, non-residents can’t buy a house to rent out or use as a
                holiday home.
                Foreign residents can apply to buy a house for redevelopment, such as knocking down an old house to
                build an apartment block. This is usually only approved as long as two houses are built for every one
                demolished, to encourage greater housing development.
                Foreign companies with a significant local presence can purchase homes to house their Australian staff,
                although companies cannot buy property for investment or renting.
            </p>
            <h4>How do I apply to the FIRB?)</h4>

            <p>
                Applying to the FIRB is a fairly straightforward process: You simply fill out a foreign investment
                application form on the Australian Tax Office (ATO) website, and then pay an application fee which
                depends on the worth of the property you’re looking to buy. Fees start at $5,000 for properties worth $1
                million or less, $10,100 for properties between $1 million and $2 million, and then fees rise by
                approximately $10,000 for each price bracket up to $10 million.
                Applications can take up to 30 days to be approved or rejected, and it can take a further 10 days before
                you are informed. While this waiting period can be frustrating, it’s important to remember that
                purchasing any real estate without already having approval is a breach of Australian law. You can speed
                things along, however, by negotiating a contract which is conditional upon you receiving approval. This
                is a great compromise for those looking to purchase a property that may be in high demand.
                As a buyer from overseas, you still have to pay all local taxes and bills on your new property, which
                may include council rates, body corporate fees, and much more. If you decide to sell your property in
                the future, there is also a 10% withholding of capital gains tax that you will pay to the ATO. As you
                can see, buying property in Australia can involve a significant expense.
            </p>
            <h4> Can a non-permanent resident get a mortgage?</h4>
            <p>
                If your application to FIRB was approved, congratulations! Now you can get on with the process of buying
                a house.
                If you’re looking to take out a mortgage for your new property, you’ll also need to consider a home loan
                from an Australian bank.

            <h3 style="margin-left: 45%; font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;">Papua New Guinea</h3>

            <p>If you are considering purchasing a property in Papua New Guinea then you might like to consider going
                through this basic guide. Note that this guide relates to alienated land (not customary) of which the
                land is duly registered in the Land Title Registry at the Department of Lands.
            </p>
            <h4> Finance</h4>
            <p>You might already be looking for a property but the first most important step is to have the necessary
                finance ready. In most cases, you will need the assistance of a bank or financial institution for the
                purchase.

                It’s important to sort your finance out not only because there’s no other to pay for the property but
                also to know your budget and the kind of property you will be looking at to buy.

                Talk to the bank about your needs and your financial standing so that they can better understand your
                requirements and offer a product that best meets your needs.

                The BSP bank calculator is a good starting point to have an idea of how much you will be required to pay
                in repayments of the loan. Note that although the calculator is helpful, it should not be solely relied
                on as the Bank has other factors to take into account which the calculator may not cover.
            </p>
            <h4>Hunting for property</h4>

            <p>Once you have a fair idea of your budget, it’s time to go looking for a property that fits the budget. No
                doubt you may have already seen a few properties prior to looking for finance but now with a firm idea
                on your budget it’s time to look around with a bit more certainty, negotiate and if all goes well enter
                into agreement with the relevant real estate agent or owner on the price and other factors on your
                purchase.

                Note that a real estate agent is usually acting in the best interest of the seller, not you. So don’t
                always agree to everything they say but consider it carefully and determine whether it meets your
                requirements.

                Always ask questions to the agent and the owner about the property such as its features, what’s included
                in the sale and any other important feature you should know about the property.

                The questioning and negotiations on price may take some time but it’s better to be thorough in the whole
                process then finding out later that what you were told is in fact not true. You’re making a big
                purchase, so make sure you know everything about the property and most importantly you agree on a price
                that you’re happy with. That brings us to the next step – valuation.

            </p>
            <h4>Valuation</h4>
            <p>
                Knowing the value of a property is important simply because you don’t want to spend more on the property
                than what it is actually worth. The bank who has agreed to finance the property will no doubt conduct
                its own valuation but it’s important for you to have an idea of the value of the property during the
                negotiation stages so that you try and come to agree to a price that is equal to or less than the value
                of the property.
                You can either hire your own valuer at your own cost or conduct your own investigations on what the
                going rate is for a similar property in the same area. Check the local real estate property listings and
                see what similar properties are priced at. Again, that will only be guess work but that’s part of the
                whole process unless of course you pay for a valuer to do this.
            </p>

            <h4>Agreeing to terms</h4>
            <p>Once you have agreed to terms and the price with the owner, this should be put in writing. Normally, you
                will make a written offer to the seller and the seller will in return agree or disagree in writing. When
                informing the seller of your price, always make sure that you let the seller know that the purchase will
                be financed by a bank. This is important because it lets the seller know that what has been agreed to is
                preliminary and the sale is dependent on the bank formally agreeing to finance the purchase.

                At this point, you should inform your financier of the agreement and the financier will then further
                consider your loan application taking into account the relevant property, the price and other terms of
                the sale.

                You will be informed by your financier whether your loan application has been approved or not.

                Deposit
                To secure a property you will need to pay a deposit to the owner or the real estate agent. It may be
                best to hold off paying the deposit until the bank has officially approved your loan application.

                It is possible to pay the deposit once terms are agreed to at the initial stages just to secure the
                property however the problem with this is that should the bank decline your application, it will be your
                responsibility to chase the owner for the deposit paid. Not only is this a frustrating task where the
                owner holds off paying the deposit it will not be surprising of the owner deducts a certain amount for a
                lost opportunity.

                So don’t pay any money until all your finance is in place.

                The rate of deposit under current practices is 10% of the purchase price. So if the property you want to
                buy is K500,000 than you will be required to pay K50,000 as a deposit.

                When paying the deposit be very careful to whom you pay it to. So if you do pay the deposit, pay it to a
                reputable real estate agent or the lawyer for the seller. Paying it to either of these two is more
                secure as both will deposit it into their trust account pending completion of the sale. How the deposit
                is dealt with will be determined by the contract for sale of land which is normally drafted by the
                seller’s lawyers.

                Contract for sale of land

                Once the deposit is paid this triggers the lawyers (usually the seller’s lawyer) to draft the contracts.
                In the meantime, you too will need to obtain the services of a lawyer and they will conduct checks with
                the Department of Lands and other relevant statutory organisations to ensure that the owner has good
                clear title and that there are no issues with the transfer of the title to you. If any issues are
                encountered, your lawyer will normally raise this with the seller’s lawyer and have them resolved prior
                to finalising the contract.

                Once the terms of the contracts are agreed, both parties will then sign the contract for sale of land.

                Stamp duty

                Stamp duty is normally payable on transfer of real property. The amount of duty depends on the value of
                the property.

                The seller’s lawyer on obtaining the signed contracts by both parties will then submit the documents to
                the Internal Revenue Commission for stamping. If duty is payable, it is normally the responsibility of
                the purchaser, which is you, to pay the duty. Note that the duty is separate from the purchase price so
                you will be expected to pay over and above the purchase price if you are to purchase this property. Your
                lawyer should advise you on the amount of duty you may likely pay.

                There are some concessions available for first home buyers and you should ask your lawyer of this and
                other applicable concessions.

                Ministerial approval

                Under the relevant legislation, there are certain categories of people that require Ministerial
                approval. Citizens are normally exempt and do not require such approval by the Minister of Lands or his
                delegate. However, non-citizens and those who purchase under a company name will require Ministerial
                approval.

                Depending on your status, your lawyer will advise you whether approval is required or not. If approval
                is not required, then it lessens the time to completion of the sale. If approval is required, then it
                can take a while for Ministerial approval to be granted.

                Settlement

                Once all necessary statutory approvals have been obtained the sellers lawyers will advise your lawyer
                and your financier (where relevant) on the date and venue of settlement. At settlement, your lawyer and
                your financier will take a look at all documents such as the contract and title to ensure that they are
                in order before handing over the bank cheques for the purchase price.

                If there are any issues with the title or any document that is necessary to assist you register your
                name as the new owner or the financier as mortgagee either may refuse to settle until the issue is
                resolved. If all is well, you, your lawyer or financier will then have the relevant documents for you to
                be recorded as the new owner on the title and where relevant the financier as the mortgagee.

                Registration

                At settlement, what you your lawyer or your financier will have on settlement is the necessary documents
                that enable you to be registered as the new owner. The next step depending on who has these documents
                will be to actually file these documents with the Department of Lands to have your name recorded and
                registered in the title register.

                Normally, if you are purchasing with assistance from a bank or other financial institution, the
                registration documents normally consisting of the title, contract, transfer instrument and mortgage
                documents will be held by the financier and will attend to registration of these documents. Once the
                documents are registered, the financier will hold the original title with your name as the new owner and
                the bank as mortgagee until you have settled your loan with the mortgagee (lender).

            <h3 style="margin-left: 45%; font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;">Dubai</h3>

            <p>Whether it’s the allure of a luxurious lifestyle or the temptation of living tax-free, moving to Dubai is
                an option that many potential expats have considered.

                Thanks to the plentiful malls and beaches, thousands of high-end shops and restaurants, bustling
                industry as well as activities like dune surfing or outdoor-activities-made-indoor like skiing, both
                visitors and prospective residents alike find it hard to miss the many advantages to living in the
                middle eastern city.

                If you’re looking to invest or considering a move - whether it’s for work, to start a business, or just
                to enjoy life in Dubai - you’ve probably already considered buying property in the emirate. Thanks to
                the passing of 2002’s Freehold Law, doing so is a distinct possibility, with foreigners retaining the
                right to buy, sell and rent property in Dubai without any special regulations or permissions. And, with
                more than 70% of the emirate’s population made up of expats, it’s not at all uncommon for foreigners to
                purchase land and homes.

                That being said, a similar number of residents - just under 70% - don’t own their own property in the
                city. There are a few reasons for this, though many residents cite their lack of surety about how long
                they’ll stay in the emirate as their reason for renting. Another big roadblock? The required 25% deposit
                you’ll have to put down when buying a home. If you can get past those hurdles, however, owning property
                can be your ticket to an excellent investment or a seriously fun lifestyle.

                Regardless, it’s important to understand all the intricacies of buying property in Dubai before deciding
                to make a purchase. This guide will walk you through what you need to know about buying your own place
                in the emirate.
            </p>
            <h4>What’s the property market like in Dubai?</h4>
            <p>The property market in Dubai has suffered a series of rises and falls in recent years, though the market
                as a whole is considered to be generally steady. That being said, housing prices fell 17% between 2014
                and 2016, and are likely to fall even further in 2017 despite a small rise in December 2016. At the
                moment, experts are somewhat divided between considering this the market bottom - and predicting a
                steady rise from here - and predicting a further fall before the trend reverses.

                All in all, this may be a good time to buy vs. renting in Dubai, as property prices are low for the area
                and will eventually rise, as the UAE Dirham is inextricably tied to the currently strong U.S. dollar.
            </p>
            <h4>Can foreigners buy property in Dubai?</h4>

            <p>Yes. Thanks to legal changes in 2002, foreigners can buy, sell and rent property in Dubai without any
                special regulations or permissions.</p>
            <h4>What’s the approximate cost of different properties in Dubai?</h4>
            <p>
                As you embark on your property search, it’s a good idea to have a ballpark estimate of how much an
                apartment, home or land should cost.

        <!--Qatar-->
        <div class="SouthAfrica" id="Qatarflag" style="display:none;border-top: 2px solid #245269">

            <h3 style="margin-left: 45%; font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;">Qatar</h3>

            <p>The property market in Qatar has only been open to non-Qataris for a relatively short time. Expats are
                permitted to buy freehold properties in certain designated developments only. However, they can also
                legally buy 99-year leasehold rights to residential units in other parts of the country. The huge
                advantage of purchasing a home is that property owners are now automatically entitled to a residency
                visa for themselves and their family.
                However, expats should know that there are also some risks involved. After the latest global financial
                crisis, property prices experienced a sharp dip. The market for foreigners is generally still at an
                early stage, and there is no secondary market yet established. Many non-Qataris have purchased
                properties in new developments off-plan, with prices being agreed before the market became so volatile.
            </p>
            <h4>Regulations.</h4>
            <p>A regulation which was introduced in 2004 allowed expats to buy property in various large-scale
                developments, but only since 2009, as these projects have been finished, have the first formal
                transactions with non-Qataris been completed.

                There are three main freehold developments in Qatar: Pearl Qatar, West Bay Lagoon and Al Khor Resort
                Project. These developments include apartment blocks, commercial properties and some villas. The
                developers of particular properties can advise initially whether it is legal for foreigners to purchase
                a unit. However, this should be always verified with Doha Municipality or the Ministry of Justice’s Real
                Estate Registration Department, or the estate agent.

                There are some properties in other areas that can be sold to non-Qataris on a limited leasehold basis.
                Thorough investigations must be made by the purchaser to get to know the property’s status before making
                a commitment to purchase. It should be noted that fewer than 100 non-Qataris were reported to have
                completed purchases by early 2011, and only 10 of those had obtained the associated property-owner’s
                residence permit, so it is still quite difficult to buy property in this country.
            </p>
            <h4>Property Owner’s Visa.</h4>

            <p>Non-Qatari home purchasers can apply for a homeowner’s residence permit, which is then valid for five
                years and allows the owners and their immediate families to live in Qatar. The application process for
                the visa is similar to process when obtaining a work residence permit. It also requires proof of
                ownership documents, replacing the need for a sponsoring employer. A medical certificate is still
                required, and a Certificate of Good Conduct must be obtained from the purchaser’s embassy.
                Once it is confirmed that the property is in a permitted area and that the property is registered, the
                buyer must go to the office for registration of real estate for non-Qatari nationals, which is located
                in the Doha Municipality office in Al Sadd. The visa can then be processed by the Ministry of Interior.

            </p>
            <h4>The buying process</h4>
            <p>
                As has already been explained, the property market in Doha is still in an early stage. Expats should
                also know that the estate agency business in the country is in the same situation. Some properties are
                advertised through estate agents, and a reputable agent should be able to assist buyers with a search
                for a specific type of property. The problem is that this industry is not yet regulated, so it is maybe
                best to ask around for recommendations from colleagues who have already experienced this and check some
                internet forums before proceeding with an agent.

                When it comes to some bigger projects such as the Pearl, it is possible to buy property directly from
                the developer. Any buying method will probably involve some kind of fee for a completed purchase.
                Therefore, it is very important to know all the costs involved, and to obtain a written quote if
                possible. Private sales are less common due to the absence of an established secondary sales market.


            </p>
            <h4>Buying off-plan.</h4>
            <p>Buying off-plan is quite common in Qatar. This involves purchasing a unit in an apartment block before it
                has been built. While this is certainly cheaper than buying a completed property, it is also quite
                risky. For example, these projects can be delayed or even never completed. Sometimes the plans change
                after the purchase.</p>
            <h4>Contracts and documents.</h4>
            <p>When purchasing the property, contracts should be drawn up or verified by a lawyer. It is important to
                know that legal documents in Qatar are always written in Arabic. A lawyer should also carry out a due
                diligence process on all relevant aspects, such as obtaining and verifying any necessary building
                licenses, planning permission consents, and company registration documents of developers or sellers, and
                a secure payment agreement should be set up for any installment or deposit transactions.</p>
            <h4>Registering the property</h4>
            <p>
                The process of registering the property in Qatar can be quite complex. Therefore, it's smart to take the
                advice of a reputable property lawyer or reliable estate agent or developer’s representative. Once these
                contracts have been exchanged, the purchaser must take the property title deeds, signed contracts and
                either final payment confirmation or mortgage and deposit details to Qatar’s Real Estate Registration
                and Authentication Department at the Ministry of Municipality and Urban Planning. There are numerous
                application forms that need to be completed and some documents verified. At least one of the parties
                needs to be present in person while doing this. Registration must then be completed at the Ministry of
                Justice’s Real Estate Registration Department.
            </p>
            <p>Fees
                As there is no particular property tax in Qatar, the buyer at this stage must also pay a transfer fee of
                0.25 percent of the value of the property, and then a final, binding confirmation contract is approved.
                Fees may also be charged by the developer for "extras", which are services such as ongoing maintenance,
                car park fees or other facilities. At this stage, it is essential to be aware of these before the
                purchase is agreed on.

                Mortgages
                The majority of bigger banks which are based in Qatar offer mortgage facilities for property purchases,
                although lending conditions are much less favourable after the global economic crisis. Deposits that are
                required can vary from lender to lender, and they depend on the value of the property that is being
                purchased.

                Agreement in principle
                Mortgages can be agreed in principle before a property bid is made, but confirmation of the mortgage is
                based upon the bank’s assessment of the value of the actual property being purchased.

                Interest rates
                Interest rates and lengths of mortgages can vary as well. Islamic banks do not charge interest, in
                compliance with Sharia law, but they usually have a shorter repayment term.

                Restrictions
                Some developers have links with particular banks, so the purchaser may be obliged to take out a mortgage
                from that particular institution.

            <h3 style="margin-left: 45%; font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;">Brazil</h3>

            <p>Legal Assistance
                We advise you to use a trusted client lawyer when purchasing who will ensure your interests are
                protected. We recommend that you use a Brazilian Lawyer who is registered with the OAB (Ordem Dos
                Advogados Do Brasil) which is the equivalent to the Bar in the UK. You would also have more protection
                if they are also registered with the society in your own country (I.e. UK Law Society).

                A good lawyers' service should include:
                Checking the current owners have the correct entitlement to the land and debts
                Checking your contract and clearly advising what the obligations are for both parties
                Supporting you through the payment process and general Legal questions
                Ensuring the land is registered in your name correctly at the end of the process.

                Foreigners Owning Land / Property
                The Brazilian authorities encourage foreign investment, as such there are no major restrictions for
                foreigners to buy and sell residential or commercial property in Brazil. There are however some
                limitations and/or fees applicable for specific areas such as marine land, Islands, agricultural land
                and areas near Brazil's International borders.

                Land Registry
                Property is registered in Brazil via private notary publics, under justice control. The real estate
                registry in Brazil is such that each property can only be registered at one registry which stores the
                entire transaction history and physical identification of each property. The access to all information
                of a property is public. Thus many Brazilians buy and sell property without a lawyer. We recommend that
                you use a lawyer to help you with the purchase.
                Land registry costs, when buying property in Brazil can vary depending on the state the property is
                purchased in. We usually state the approximate registration costs within the property details. The taxes
                are as follows:
                Stamp Duty Tax (or Registration tax) is around 2% of the purchase price (payable to the notary)
                Property Transfer Tax (ITBI) of approx 3% (payable at the City Hall).
                'Navy Marine Tax' of approx 2% (generally only if a property is located front line beach although there
                are other cases where this is applicable)
                Taxes can vary (only by fractions of a percent) depending on which State you buy your property in.

                Visas / Passport
                Travelers from most countries will receive an automatic visitors visa entry when visiting Brazil, this
                is granted for 90 days. It is possible to apply for an extension for a further 90 days at the local
                police station. Travellers from some countries (particularly the U.S. A.) are required to apply for a
                Brazilian Visitors Visa at their nearest Brazilian Embassy before travel.
                Before travelling to Brazil you should have at least 6 months from the return date of your journey until
                your passport expires.

                Permanent Residency
                There is a criteria to meet to qualify for Permanent Residency, residency is dependent on the
                governments criteria. Your chosen legal advisor will be able to assist you if you apply for residency.

                Flights
                Flight costs to Brazil are still generally quite expensive but there are indications that these are
                starting to reduce as the market continues to open up and the market becomes more competitive as it
                certainly will do. Prices fluctuate depending on the season / operator and destination airport.
                A flight to the northeast of Brazil usually takes about 8 to 9 hours from the UK.


                Money Transfers to Brazil
                It is imperative when buying property in Brazil that the funds are sent directly from your own bank
                account to the sellers bank account in Brazil, this being sent via the Central Bank of Brazil who will
                provide an official receipt of funds into the country. The seller is then required to present their
                contract to the Bank to release the funds. This ensures the government have recorded your investment
                into the country. Please be careful of developers / sellers who do not use the official route.

                Your bank will not be able to offer an exchange rate at the time of transfer as the money is
                crystallized when it reaches Brazil (approx 5 days transfer time). There will usually be a shortfall or
                overpayment, we will help you manage any transfers and liaise with your banks to ensure that the process
                works smoothly.

                Borrowing Money to Buy Property
                It is not impossible to borrow funds in Brazil to buy a property but it is expensive and the market is
                not mature. If the repayments are being made from overseas then there is also a currency risk - So
                generally, we would not recommend this route. Some new build off-plan developments may be offered by the
                developer with instalment payments over a short period of time (I.e. say over 12 to 24 months). The
                charges applicable vary from developer to developer. Because Brazil's economy is doing well, the
                currency has been strengthening, so you need to be mindful that the actual price you pay in your own
                currency could increase.

                If you have property in your own country and would like to borrow against this, then you would be wise
                to speak with your own Financial Advisor.

        <div class="SouthAfrica" id="Venezuelaflag" style="display:none;border-top: 2px solid #245269">

            <h3 style="margin-left: 45%; font-size: 20px;font-weight: bold;">Venezuela </h3>
            <p>How difficult is the property purchase process in Venezuela?
                Any foreigner can buy a property in Venezuela with just a valid passport, a tourist visa and a Registro
                de Informacion Fiscal (RIF). The RIF is a fiscal identification for all persons, and can be obtained for
                free by request at any Tax Administration office or the Servicio Nacional Integrado de Aministracion or
                through a lawyer. Foreigners may also buy indirectly, through local companies or through foreign
                companies.

                When you have chosen a property, inform your real estate agent and apply formally with a written
                document (informe de la documentacion). Require the real estate agent to be present to assist in the
                negotiation and closing of the deal, including the mode of payment. The real estate agent should mediate
                in all negotiations between you, and the seller of the property.

                It is best to negotiate with a seller through an "opcion a compra" or "option to buy", which legally
                "locks" both seller and buyer. The seller has to sell and you have to buy. It also "locks" the price. An
                "option a compra" usually requires a deposit of between 10% and 30% of the agreed selling price.

                Buyers pay in advance all registration fees and legal expenses and the seller is obligated to deliver
                the property free of lien. A buyer is expected to pay in cash in advance in local currency from 1% to
                3%, to handle everything up to and including closing.

                After the final document has been signed, it is notarized by the notary public, and the buyer is now the
                legal owner, and the title or deed is handed over by the seller.

                The Certificate of Encumbrances is not required by law but is usually practiced and requested by
                purchaser.

                Fundamental Guidelines when buying a property in Venezuela by the Real Estate Chamber of Venezuela
                (Comision de Intermediacion y Asesoria Inmobiliaria de la Camara Inmobiliaria de Venezuela):

                Financial Commission - If the deal is paid through credit, the buyer should see that the commission to
                the bank or other financial institution is canceled.

                Insurance - In the case of property acquisition through mortgage, there is a need for insurance against
                fire and earthquake. Insurance agencies normally charge a year in advance.

                Margarita Island
                Margarita Island, a piece of paradise in the Caribbean belonging to Venezuela, is very popular with
                foreigners. It lies off the northern coast of Venezuela, and is the most southerly of all the Caribbean
                islands. Its location means that it is out of the hurricane belt and offers low humidity and low
                rainfall. A duty free status was granted in 1966 and then upgraded to free port status in 1976.
                Transport is via Caracas international airport, or by modern ferries.

                The whole process of registering a property in Venezuela can be completed in around 38 days.
